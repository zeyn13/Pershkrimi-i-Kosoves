        Gjakova is the seventh largest city of Kosovo and seat of Gjakova Municipality and Gjakova District.
        The city has 40,827 inhabitants, while the municipality has 94,556 inhabitants.
        Geographically, it is located in the south-western part of Kosovo, about halfway between the cities of Peja and Prizren.
        It is approximately 100 km (62 mi) inland from the Adriatic Sea. The city is situated some 208 kilometres (129 mi) north-east of Tirana,
        145 kilometres (90 mi) north-west of Skopje, 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of the capital Pristina,
        435 kilometres (270 mi) south of Belgrade and 263 kilometres (163 mi) east of Podgorica.
        The city of Gjakova has been populated since the prehistoric era. During the Ottoman period,
        Gjakova served as a trading centre on the route between Shkodra and Constantinople.
        It was also one of the most developed trade centres at that time in the Balkans.

             Gjakova suffered greatly from the Serbian and Montenegrin armies during the First Balkan War.
             The New York Times reported in 1912, citing Austro-Hungarian sources, that people on the gallows hanged on both sides of the road, and that the way to Gjakova became a "gallows alley."[8] In the region of Gjakova, the Montenegrin military police formed the Royal Gendarmerie Corps (Kraljevski žandarmerijski kor), known as krilaši, which committed much abuse and violence against the non-Orthodox Christian population.
             The city was badly affected by the Kosovo War, suffering great physical destruction and large-scale human losses and human rights abuses.
             Yugoslav units were stationed in and near the city in two barracks due to the risk of an attack by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
             from across the border in Albania. In one incident, NATO aircraft misidentified a convoy of Albanian refugees and attacked it.
             After the war in Kosovo, the Clock Tower of Gjakova was restored, though in a style different from the original tower.
             Actions on the ground had a devastating effect on the city. According to the ICTY, OSCE, and international human rights organisations,
             about 75% of the population was expelled by Serbian police and paramilitaries as well as Yugoslav forces, while many civilians were killed in the process.
             Large areas of the city were destroyed,
             chiefly through arson and looting but also in the course of localised fighting between government security forces and members of the KLA.
             The actions of the government forces in Gjakova formed a major part of the United Nations war crimes indictment of the then-President Slobodan Milošević.
             In 2011, several dozen corpses were identified and returned to their families,
             though the number is relatively small compared to the figures of those who are still missing.
             Most of the Albanian population returned following the end of the war.
             In 2001 free elections were held, with a majority won by LDK.
             Thousands of new stores were rebuilt.

            Gjakova is located in the south-western part of Kosovo.
            To the north-east of the city, the west Kosovan plain of Metohija opens,
            while in the south-west the peak of Albanian Alps rises. The city is also situated at the entrance to the Erenik Valley, 
            where the river Krena flows from the north to the Erenik mountain stream. After a few kilometers, it flows into the White Drin,
            the longest river in Kosovo.

            Gjakova built an economy based on farming and agriculture,
            lower trade and some types of manufacturing workshops which mainly produce for the needs of city-based products as imported cases. After World War II,
            Gjakova has built an economy based on industry and agriculture but also in the service sector.
            Nowadays, these subsequent shifts in transitional societies are escorted with shifts in the economic structure of the city. Therefore,
            Gjakova has an economic structure that is based on two pillars:
            in the private business sector and social business sector which is currently being privatized.
            Private business sector is in expansion and the main indicators qualify it as the main component of Gjakova's economy.

            Gjakova has a long tradition of education since the beginning of civil life.
            According to the Gjakova tradition the Hadim Aga library was so rich in books so it was said "Who wants to see the Kaaba,
            let them visit the library of Hadim Aga". The library had a reading room on the ground floor and the shelf with books upstairs.

          According to the 2011 census, the resident population was 94,556,
          of which urban inhabitants numbered 40,827 and rural 53,729; there were 47,226 males and 47,330 females.
          The ethnic groups include Albanians (87,672), Balkan Egyptians (5,117), Roma (738), Ashkali (613), and smaller numbers of Bosniaks (73), Serbs (17),
          Turks (16), Gorani (13) and others. Based on those that answered, the religious make-up was 77,299 Muslims, 16,296 Roman Catholics, 22 Orthodox Christians
          142 others, and 129 irreligious. Based on the population estimates from the Kosovo Agency of Statistics in 2016, the municipality has 95,433 inhabitants.
          According to OSCE estimations, before the Kosovo War of 1999 the municipality had a population of about 145,000,
          of which 93% were Kosovo Albanians and 7% non-majority communities, including some 3,000 Serbs, who mostly lived in Gjakova itself.

            Historical monuments in Gjakova are divided into three main categories based on their cultural,
            religious and social context. The core part of the city was created between the Krena River to the east and Cabrati hill to the west.
            Around the cornerstone of the town, the Old Bazaar – the center of trade and craftsmanship – was created.
            By 1900, the bazaar housed around 1000 enterprises.
            Numerous bridges were built to enable the journey of trade caravans across the neighboring rivers.
            With the fast development of trade in the city, several inns were built to host the many visitors.
            Because of its ancient origins and fast economic development, Gjakova has become of great historical importance.
