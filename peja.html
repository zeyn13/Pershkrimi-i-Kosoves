        Peja (definite Albanian form: Pejë pronounced [pɛˈjə]) or Peć
        is the fourth largest city of Kosovo and seat of Peja Municipality and Peja District.
        It is situated in the region of Rugova on the eastern section of the Accursed Mountains along Peja's Lumbardh in the western part of Kosovo.
        In medieval times the city, then commonly known under its Serbian name, was the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1346.
        The Patriarchal monastery of Peć is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Medieval Monuments in Kosovo.
        Under Ottoman rule the city, then commonly known under the Turkish name İpek, became a district capital with mosques and civil architecture.
        From the end of the nineteenth century until today,the city has been the site of nationalist aspirations and claims for both
        ethnic Albanians and Serbs, often resulting in tense inter-ethnic relations and conflict.

             The city is located in a strategic position on Peja's Lumbardh, a tributary of the White Drin to the east of the Accursed Mountains
             The medieval city was possibly built on the ruins of Siparant(um), a Roman municipium (town or city).
             The area has the most unearthed stelae in all of Kosovo.
             Slavs (Sclaveni and Antes) settled the Balkans, heavily depopulated by "Barbarians", in the 6th century.
             The Byzantine Empire and the First Bulgarian Empire fought for control of the area until it finally fell under full Serbian control.
             Between 1180 and 1190,
             Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja liberated Peja with its surrounding župa (district) of Hvosno from the Byzantine Empire,
             thus establishing Serbian rule over the city of Peja for next 300 years.
             In 1220, Serbian King Stefan Nemanjić donated Peja and several surrounding villages to his newly founded monastery of Žiča.
             As Žiča was the seat of a Serbian archbishop,
             Peja came under direct rule of Serbian archbishops and later patriarchs who built their residences and numerous churches in the
             city starting with the church of Holy Apostles built by archbishop Saint Arsenije I Sremac.
             After the Žiča monastery was burned by the Cumans (between 1276 and 1292) the seat of Serbian archbishop was transferred to a
             more secure location - Patriarchal Monastery of Peć where it remained until the abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć in 1766.

             After World War I, the city became part of Yugoslavia (at first officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes).
             Between 1931 and 1941 the city was part of Zeta Banovina.
             During World War II Peja was occupied by the Italian puppet state of Albania.
