    <p>
        Ferizaj or Uroševac is the third largest city of Kosovo and seat of
        Ferizaj Municipality and Ferizaj District.
        Ferizaj has been populated since the prehistoric era by the Starčevo,
        Vinča and Baden culture. During the Ottoman period,
        Ferizaj served as a trading center on the route between Belgrade and Thessaloniki.
        Ferizaj has always been considered as a city where tolerance and coexistence in terms
        of religion and culture has been part of the society in the last centuries.
        During and after the Kosovo War in 1999,
        the US Army base Camp Bondsteel was established outside of the city,
        now being used by forces belonging to KFOR.
        It is the largest and the most expensive foreign military base built by
        the Americans in South Eastern Europe, since the Vietnam War.
        Ferizaj is located in the south-eastern part of Kosovo,
        about halfway between the cities of Pristina and Skopje.
        It is some 230 kilometres north-east of Tirana, 55 kilometres north of Skopje,
        300 kilometres west of Sofia,
        35 kilometres south of Pristina and 300 kilometres east of Podgorica.
        Ferizaj is also famous for a geographic phenomenon known as river bifurcation.
        The Nerodimka river is divided in two branches and they end up on two different seas.

            The oldest group who lived in the 6th and 5th millenniums BC in the territory of Kosovo was the Starčevo culture
            Members of this group constructed their homes near rivers and the river terraces.
            They made their homes of willows and mud, while their main profession was plowing and farming.
            In the next archaeological period, the Vinča culture developed in some parts of Kosovo.
            These population shifts were made around 4300 BC. The newcomers also built their habitats near rivers.
            These habitats were unfortified, with dense rows of willows and mud houses. Remnants of their material culture,
            mostly different forms of ceramic vessels and the large numbers of baked clay figures, testify on a higher cultural level.
            After Starčevo and Vinča, the Bubanj-Hum culture followed.
            This cultural group expanded from the east, from the territory of today's Bulgaria.
            When carriers of this ethno-cultural group reached the region before the end of the 6th millennium BC,
            they destroyed Vinča habitats. Remnants of their material culture have not survived.
            After Bubanj-Hum, the Baden culture arrived from the Danube, representing its southernmost influence in Kosovo.
            Baden culture ended before the end of the 3rd millennium BC.
            Starting from the 8th century BC and then during the next centuries,
            until the Roman conquest, can transmit continuously development of a new culture in the region, the Dardanian tribe.
            The Dardanian burned their dead and bury their remnants in tumuli tombs.
            In the city, two necropoleis have been found, one in the locality of Kuline near the railway station in Gërlicë, the other in region of Mollopolc,
            along the Ferizaj-Štimlje road.

            The Big Mosque of Mulla Veseli built in 1891, and the St.
            Uroš Orthodox Cathedral in the centre of Ferizaj are considered symbolic of religious tolerance
            between Muslim Albanians and Christian Serbs.
            Because the mosque and the church are next to one another,
            many people like to take photos of them.
            The mosque was destroyed during World War II, but then rebuilt. 
            During the Kosovo War in 1999 neither were destroyed, but in March 2004 during unrest in Kosovo,
            the church was attacked.
            The development of art and culture in Kosovo is closely related to the cultural and artistic society (CAS).
            The composer Lorenc Antoni lived in Ferizaj in the early 40s,
            and the composer Venqenc Gjini from Ferizaj has also made many contributions to culture and is respected countrywide,
            especially for his creative idioms inspired by the popular fountain.
            Ferizaj is also famous for its Ensemble of Song and Dance "Kastriotët", which was founded in 1967.
