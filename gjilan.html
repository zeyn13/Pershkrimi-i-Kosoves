             In 1342, a place called Morava was visited by Serbian King Stefan Dušan (later Emperor, r. 1331–1355).
             fort was built nearby in the 14th century. Gornja Morava ("Upper Morava") was known as simply Morava under Ottoman rule,
             and it extended west of the Upper Žegra–Budriga–Cernica line, thus Gjilan stayed in the oblast (province) of Topolnica,
             which provincial seat was Novo Brdo.
             In the 1455 defter (Ottoman tax registry), Gjilan was inhabited by Serbs, and the priest Božidar served the town.
