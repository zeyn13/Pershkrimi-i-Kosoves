            </ul>
        There is archaeological evidence that proves the region of Mitrovica has been inhabited since the Neolithic era.
        Two settlements were discovered in 1955 in the industrial park near the FAFOS factory (phosphates productions),
        from which the archaeological site got the name. In Fafos, settlements revealed different objects of everyday use
         but the most characteristic were cult objects (small anthropomorphic figures) of the Vinča culture.</li>

                </ul>
            In 1997 the Kosovo Liberation Army was formed so Milosevic started a brutal campaign against it in 1998.
            For such reason NATO started Military campaign so it could protect the civilian population from Milosevic.
            In March 1999 the scorpions killed 14 Albanian civilians.
            After the war, the process of establishing Municipal Assembly began in 2002.
            Later in 17 of February 2008 Kosovo declared its independence.
            During the Kosovo War (1998-1999), the town was the site of the Podujevo massacre, on March 28,
            in which 14 Kosovo Albanian women and children were executed by Serbian paramilitary forces.</li>
